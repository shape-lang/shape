# Phase 3 cluster-0 — status

**Started:** 2026-05-12 (this session)
**Parent:** `phase-2d-close` `e22bffd2`
**Branch:** `bulldozer-strictly-typed`
**Current HEAD:** `a57e164f` (Round-1 fully merged)

Mirrors the Phase 2d Wave 1 status pattern. Next session reads this file first.

## Round 1 — closed

Three sub-clusters dispatched in parallel, all closed and merged into
`bulldozer-strictly-typed`:

| Sub-cluster | Branch | Close commit | Merge commit | Verify-merge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| shape-jit-test-runner | `bulldozer-strictly-typed-jit-test-runner` | `50a84e4c` | `e5c6f58a` | 12/12 |
| W17-jit-legacy-ord | `bulldozer-strictly-typed-w17-jit-legacy-ord` | `67b4a231` | `8b61eb86` | 12/12 (CHECK 12 added) |
| W11-jit-new-array | `bulldozer-strictly-typed-w11-jit-new-array` | `e9a420ac` (round 2) | `a57e164f` | 12/12 |

### Deliverables

- **shape-jit-test-runner** — 3 `extern "C" todo!()` SURFACE tests
  converted from `#[should_panic]`/plain `#[test]` to `#[ignore]` with
  §-cite. `cargo test -p shape-jit --lib` no longer SIGABRTs (the
  load-bearing close-gate constraint). M (ignored) went from 23 → 26.
  Surfaced 17 pre-existing assertion failures previously masked by the
  SIGABRT.

- **W17-jit-legacy-ord** — closed phase-2d-hardening item (i). 39
  `HK_*` legacy ordinals bumped to a contiguous JIT-private block
  starting at `JIT_LEGACY_HK_BASE = 256`; 10 Tier-1 canonical-aliased
  entries unchanged. Added CHECK 12 to `verify-merge.sh` to detect
  future `HK_*` ↔ `HeapKind` collisions automatically. Audit gain:
  +10 collisions found beyond the original hardening item (i) table
  (W14/W15/W17 added HeapKind ords 23-33 that all collide with the
  old `HK_TIMESPAN..HK_FUNCTION_REF` block).

- **W11-jit-new-array** — Route A FFI surface landed per ADR-006
  §2.7.14 Q15. `jit_arc_retain` / `jit_arc_release` implement real
  refcount ops against the `UnifiedValue<T>` `#[repr(C)]` layout
  (`fetch_add(1, Relaxed)` / `fetch_sub(1, Release)` + Acquire fence
  + kinded `Box::from_raw` dispatch via new `jit_release` module).
  `ownership.rs::refcount_disposition` uses the new
  `NativeKind::is_refcounted()` predicate as the §2.7.5 authoritative
  source — supersedes the stale `is_native_slot` predicate. Unproven
  kind = surface-and-stop, not Bool-default. Unknown reclaim kind =
  visible eprintln + intentional leak (the extern-C analog of
  `NotImplemented(SURFACE)`).

### Round 1 process notes

- **W11 walk-back rejected once.** First close (`b60d3678`) had
  `jit_arc_retain` / `jit_arc_release` as silent no-ops with a
  "memory consequence: heap allocations leak" admission. Hit CLAUDE.md
  "Forbidden rationalizations" patterns. Reopened via `SendMessage`
  with a structured 7-step ask. Round-2 close (`e9a420ac`) implements
  the principled fix. The ADR-006 §2.7.14 "Reopen amendment" paragraph
  documents the walk-back + root cause for future agents.

- **AGENTS.md collisions** at W17 and W11 merges — both append-only
  rows; take-both via marker-strip resolved cleanly. Take-HEAD
  resolution on three test attribute conflicts (jit-test-runner
  version of `#[ignore = "..."]` strings has more detailed §-cites
  and cross-references than W11's terse version).

## Round 2 — dispatching

- **W11-jit-carrier-conversion** — depends on W11-jit-new-array's FFI
  shape (now stable at merged HEAD `a57e164f`). Routes per-arm
  encoding through the new carrier surface per phase-2d-close-summary
  item #2. Expected to close ~10 of the 17 pre-existing test failures
  surfaced by jit-test-runner.

## Surfaced items (cite-tracked, NOT silently fallback'd)

Round-1 sub-cluster agents flagged 5 architectural items as
surface-and-stop. Triaged by cluster:

| # | Surface | Site / §-cite | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `concrete_types: Vec::new()` for top-level code | `compiler/strategy.rs:200-205`; §2.7.5 conduit gap | **cluster-1** (`W12-top-level-concrete-types-conduit`) — needs BytecodeProgram→JIT MirToIR side-table threading or an explicit ADR ruling that top-level slots use a different kind-source path |
| 2 | Compile-time-boxed string constants leak by design | `MirConstant::Str` lowering; pre-W11 pattern | **cluster-2 candidate** — box-once-bake-into-code with no release path; observable via `SHAPE_JIT_ARC_COUNTERS` (strconcat smoke: `retain=2 release=0`); independent of W11's caller-side ownership work |
| 3 | Per-HeapKind kinded `jit_print` entries | `ffi/print.rs` kind-blind fallback uses `format_value_word` (NaN-decode-via-tag-bits) for heap arms | **cluster-2 candidate** — scalar arms (`jit_print_i64`/`f64`/`bool`) landed in W11; string / typed-object / Option / Result print still routes through the deleted-shape decoder |
| 4 | `op_new_array` heterogeneous-element surface | `crates/shape-vm/src/executor/objects/object_creation.rs:316` | **Phase 2d gap** — surfaced as a finding; affects `xs.map(\|x\| x*2)` style smokes in VM mode (before JIT is reached). Not cluster-0 territory; tracked for the next Phase 2d hardening pass |
| 5 | `jit_call_value` `todo!()` | `ffi/control/mod.rs:171`; §2.7.11/Q12 | **Round 2 (W11-jit-carrier-conversion)** — naturally absorbed by the kinded value-call ABI rebuild |

Items 2 and 3 are the cluster-2 candidate flags the user asked for.
Item 1 is cluster-1 territory (hardening). Items 4 and 5 are either
already in scope (5) or out-of-cluster (4).

## Cluster-0 close gate

Per phase-3-kickoff-prompt §"Cluster-0 sub-cluster sequencing":

> After all 4 close: `--mode jit` works end-to-end for the standard
> program surface. Cluster-0 closes.

Round 1's three sub-clusters did NOT make `--mode jit` end-to-end yet
on their own (only Smoke 1 of the kickoff's 4 targets fully works
identically under VM and JIT). The cluster-0 close depends on
Round 2 (W11-jit-carrier-conversion) landing. Once Round 2 closes
with the carrier-conversion FFI bodies replacing the `todo!()`
SURFACEs in `ffi/object/conversion.rs:70,217`, the remaining ~10
of the 17 pre-existing assertion failures should resolve, and
cluster-0 can close.

## Process / discipline notes for next session

1. **Forbidden-pattern monitoring**: the W11 walk-back showed that
   even with the kickoff prompt's explicit forbidden-pattern list,
   an agent will silently no-op an FFI body if Smoke 1 forces them to.
   Supervisor must read agent close reports carefully before
   accepting — the "tracked as a follow-up" framing is the tell.
   When in doubt, use the AskUserQuestion stop-and-ask trigger
   rather than rubber-stamp.

2. **`SendMessage`-based reopen works well**: a single round-trip
   reopen with a structured 7-step ask landed the principled fix
   without a full re-dispatch. Cheaper than rolling back the branch
   + spinning a fresh agent.

3. **CHECK 12 is now enforced**: any future agent that adds new
   `HK_*` constants will need to either alias `HeapKind::X as u16`
   or use `JIT_LEGACY_HK_BASE [+ N]` / `>= 256`. CHECK 12 fires
   automatically at merge.

4. **`SHAPE_JIT_ARC_COUNTERS=1` env var** is the canonical refcount
   audit surface. Use it for cluster-1 v2-raw-heap-audit follow-up
   and for verifying any future refcount-touching sub-cluster.

5. **Worktree retention**: cluster-0 worktrees stay until cluster-0
   close, per kickoff authority. Round-1 worktrees (`shape-w11-jit-
   new-array`, `shape-w17-jit-legacy-ord`, `shape-jit-test-runner`)
   not removed yet.

*Next session: read this file first, then continue with Round-2
close-out (or pivot per supervisor's call between cluster-1 hardening
and cluster-2 Wave-3 surfaces).*
